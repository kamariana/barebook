# Barebook

Its architecture is based on <a href="http://itcss.io/">ITCSS</a> which is designed to aid the growth and maintainability of CSS projects. It also uses a composition of methodologies and principles such as <a href="http://bem.info/">BEM</a>, <a href="https://smacss.com/">SMACSS</a> and   <a href="http://oocss.org/">OOCSS</a>.
