      Introduction to the Life of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)
    </h1>

    <h2>
      The greatest blessings from God to us
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      The reason for Muhammad's (pbuh) success was that he was sent with a pure
      message from Allah, the creator of all mankind. This message would help us
      understand how to live our lives. It would tell us about good and bad and
      about wrong and right. This message would tell us about mankind (about you and
      me), the universe and the rest of creation around us. This message would tell
      us about Allah and about our relationship with Allah. The message also told us
      about the Hereafter, the Day of Judgment, Heaven and Hell.
    </p>
    
    <h2>
      The Qu'ran is this pure message that was revealed to Muhammad 1400 years ago.
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      The Qu'ran is this pure message that was revealed to Muhammad 1400 years ago.
      These are the words of Allah that were sent to the prophet Muhammad (pbuh).
      Allah has guarded it and kept it pure from changes and errors. The purpose or
      mission of the prophet (pbuh) was to deliver this message to Mankind and to
      follow its teachings.
    </p>
    
    <h2>
      There is no other message that has such an impact on mankind as the Qu'ran.
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      There is no other message that has such an impact on mankind as the Qu'ran.
      There are no other revealed books that have been kept pure from changes like
      the Qu'ran has. The Qu'ran has changed the lives of billions of people in the
      world. It has helped them become better people and live according to the will
      of Allah.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Many prophets that came before prophet Muhammad</h3>
    
    <p>
      There were many prophets that came before prophet Muhammad (pbuh) - 124,000 we
      are told from Hadith. The Qu'ran tells us that every nation was sent a
      prophet. The mission of the prophets was to tell their people about Allah and
      invite them to live their lives according to Allah's command. This helped them
      be good and generous people who looked after and cared for each other. The
      good people would be rewarded with heaven and the people that rebelled and
      refused the prophet would be punished with hellfire.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Messengers upon messengers</h4>
    
    <p>
      When the prophet died, the people would forget part of the message and then
      add bits to the original message. Eventually, the messages became completely
      different and the people went astray again. Allah would send another messenger
      to guide them back to the right path.
    </p>
    
    <h5>Seal of prophethood</h5>
    
    <p>
      This cycle of prophets coming and the people going astray continued for a long
      time. When Muhammad (pbuh) came, the cycle was broken. The big difference was
      that the message of Muhammad (pbuh) was for everyone and would never change.
      If the people went astray, they could turn back to the original message (the
      Qu'ran) and be guided again. If they did not understand things they could look
      into the Sunnah which is a practical guide of how the Qu'ran is followed.

      Remember your contemporaries who have passed away and were your age. Remember the honors and fame they earned, the high
      posts they held, and the beautiful bodies they possessed. Today all of them are turned to dust. They have left orphans and
      widows behind them, their wealth is being wasted, and their houses turned into ruins. No sign of them is left today, and
      they lie in dark holes underneath the earth. Picture their faces before your mind's eye and ponder.

    Imam Ghazali was one of the most influential Muslim after Prophet Muhammad (May Peace Be Upon Him). He has been acclaimed
    as Hujjat al-Islam (the Proof of Islam), Zain al-Din (the Ornament of Faith) and Mujaddid (the Renewer of Religion) – because
    of his works in intellectually debating against some of the most perilous ideas and philosophies that troubled the Muslims
    during the 11th century. One of his quotes I love says <q>Declare your jihad on thirteen enemies you cannot see – Egoism, Arrogance, Conceit, Selfishness, Greed, Lust, Intolerance,
    Anger, Lying, Cheating, Gossiping and Slandering. If you can master and destroy them, then will be ready to fight the enemy
    you can see.</q>

    <strong>Neglect not your time, nor use it haphazardly</strong>; on the contrary you should bring yourself to account. <em>Structure your litanies and other practices during each day and night</em>. This is how to bring about the spiritual blessing (barakah) in each period.
    If each of your breaths is a priceless jewel, be not like the deceived fools who are joyous because each day their wealth
    increases while their life grows ever shorter.
