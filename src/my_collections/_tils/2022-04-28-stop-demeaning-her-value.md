I was a victim of this title towards my kids and my wife -- especially my wife. 

The funny thing is that, I was so nice to my wife before we got married, so for me is like what changed when we got married. It took years to figure that out, but all praise is due to the Most High, with dua, things are better now, not excellent yet.

So how do I know, if I'm putting her down?

Norman Ali Khan says it best.

That a man being "Kawwam" is actually responsible for letting his spouse know how valuable she is. He gives her value, he appreciate her, he lets  her know that she's beautiful. And a lot of men actually do the opposite, let know how fat she is, how ugly she is, how short she is, how dark she is, how freckled she is or whatever. And the will do that constantly putting her down, demeaning her value, you get it, 

Sometimes going to the extreme of insulting her intelligence. 

"God, you're such a horrible driver ..."

"Subhanallah, you are very stupid ..."

"You don't know anything, why ..."

You get it

Stop!

And lets starting working on how our spouses can feel valuable when they are around us.
