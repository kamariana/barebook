The spreadsheet as a whole can be thought of as a database, and the worksheets within the spreadsheet can be used to describe tables within a database. A table contains rows and columns. Each row contains data for one item. Each column contains data of one specific kind for all of the items.

The rows and columns within a worksheet can be seen as analogous to the rows and columns in a table. Each row represents a single set of related data, while the columns represent a standardized way to store data for that particular attribute.

This simplified analogy serves perfectly to describe, conceptually, a database:

| Spreadsheet      | Database                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| Worksheet        | Table / Entity           |
| Worksheet Column | Table Column / Attribute |
| Worksheet Row    | Table Record / Tuple     |
