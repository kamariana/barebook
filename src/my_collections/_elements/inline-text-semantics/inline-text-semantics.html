  <strong>Neglect not your time, nor use it haphazardly</strong>; on the contrary you should bring yourself to account. <em>Structure your litanies and other practices during each day and night</em>. This is how to bring about the spiritual blessing (barakah) in each period.

  increases while their life grows ever shorter.
