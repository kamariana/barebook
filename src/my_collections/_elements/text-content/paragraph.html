  Asslamu alaykum! Welcome to the introduction to the life of Prophet Muhammad
  (Peace be upon him). There has never been a human being so well-respected,
  loved and followed as Muhammad (pbuh), the final messenger of Allah. There has
  never been a person who has changed world history so dramatically as Muhammad
  (pbuh) and his message. The Prophet (pbuh) was the single most important
  person in the history of the world.

<p>
  The reason for Muhammad's (pbuh) success was that he was sent with a pure
  message from Allah, the creator of all mankind. This message would help us
  understand how to live our lives. It would tell us about good and bad and
  about wrong and right. This message would tell us about mankind (about you and
  me), the universe and the rest of creation around us. This message would tell
  us about Allah and about our relationship with Allah. The message also told us
  about the Hereafter, the Day of Judgment, Heaven and Hell.
