<blockquote>
  <p>
    Remember your contemporaries who have passed away and were your age. Remember the honors and fame they earned, the high
    posts they held, and the beautiful bodies they possessed. Today all of them are turned to dust. They have left orphans and
    widows behind them, their wealth is being wasted, and their houses turned into ruins. No sign of them is left today, and
    they lie in dark holes underneath the earth. Picture their faces before your mind's eye and ponder.

<p>
  Imam Ghazali was one of the most influential Muslim after Prophet Muhammad (May Peace Be Upon Him). He has been acclaimed
  as Hujjat al-Islam (the Proof of Islam), Zain al-Din (the Ornament of Faith) and Mujaddid (the Renewer of Religion) – because
  of his works in intellectually debating against some of the most perilous ideas and philosophies that troubled the Muslims
  during the 11th century. One of his quotes I love says <q>Declare your jihad on thirteen enemies you cannot see – Egoism, Arrogance, Conceit, Selfishness, Greed, Lust, Intolerance,
  Anger, Lying, Cheating, Gossiping and Slandering. If you can master and destroy them, then will be ready to fight the enemy
  you can see.</q>
