Author's note:

This is an  exquisite collection of anecdotes from the lives of the Prophet Peace be upon Him, his Companions,

This <del>was a private</del>  collection of policies I collect around to help my self increase in self-awareness, nurturing my soul and strengthening my spirit.

Realtalk: You might see me smiling and think that all is good with me. But, I have difficult moments most of the time. First of all, I'm not who I want to be everyday, I often have a lot of short comings and that can make me very self-critical. Secondly, For the pass 10+ years of my life, I didn't know what I was doing or what I want; I never had a crystal clear goal of what I want until recently.

One thing that keeps me moving is that, I don’t know what is going to happen tomorrow but I know who holds tomorrow, knowing the reality of that, I was never worried about external circumstances.

These policies help me in designing the next years of my life — as you’ll see below.



This is an exquisite collection of incidents from the life of the Prophet Peace be upon Him , stories from our Islamic Heritage, and thought-provoking anecdotes from the life of the author. The aim of the book is to train the reader to enjoy living his life by practicing various self-development and inter-personal skills. What is so compelling and inspiring about this book is that, in order to highlight the benefit of using social skills, the author draws from the lives of the Prophet Peace be upon Him and his Companions.
This book is both a practical systematic guide to self-improvement and a treasure trove of historical incidents. It increases self-awareness, whilst nurturing the soul and strengthening the spirit.



But you know that exercising is not only with swords, right? You must always exercise your heart and mind, because war start with minds and hearts, you will first rasie the conquest in your hearts then you will fight in the battlefield. We are exercising with swords to strengthen our hands.

What should we do to strengthen our hearts and minds? 

The person is valued with what they want not what they are at that moment. You will aim such good things that your hearts will be good too. And your minds will be strong.

Allah SWT says "So when you have finished [your duties], the stand up [for worship] Ash-Sharh 94-7" As your dreams becomes supreme, your efforts grow too. You will stay at this time with your mind. But your dreams will affect centuries later. Dreams such things that have a supreme aim that is seen in your eyes, walk, talk etc that other can see it in you. Be valiants, who have big dreams. 

Even if you are not granted today, open the ways for your children. Plant such seeds that, they can even blossom a thousand years later.

You have to live a life by following our prophet SAW. know that nothing is precious if you are not follow

## Worship
